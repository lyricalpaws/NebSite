Hello lovely people who read these posts, I hope that you're doing well.

As of recent, especially with discord going down the shitter as it is, I've been getting more back into IRC (Internet Relay Chat), so I thought it'd be smart to let you guys know where you can find me.

I'm mostly gonna be found on [FurNet IRC](https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/FurNet_(IRC)), and [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/), with my idents and chats as the following:

FurNet Nick: Nebula

Channels: #gamerfurs, #kitsune, #SoftPaws, #taurs, #vore

Libera.Chat Nick(s): lyricalpaws, NebulaSystem, Nebula

Channels: ##eevee (founder), ##furry, ##furrysmut

I will keep this further updated if I join any other channels later on :3
