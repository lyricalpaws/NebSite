That's right, we've finally settled on a full design for Bella, with this adorable lion design by [Whitesnowpaw](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/whitesnowpaw), Bella has been with us in the system for a while now, but before he bridged over from another system into ours, but now he feels he's properly integrated with the system to the point where we're comfortable referring to him as a full fledged headmate.

He's a little, and doesn't front much at all outside of co-fronting, and is similarly completely mute outside of the headspace, within he is able to communicate to the others.

I know this post wasn't too long but we felt it would be nice to introduce him to you all properly now that he has a ref.
