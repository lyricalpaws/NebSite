Lilith is our guardian, she makes sure the others are safe and handle outside things.

Pixel is the keeper, Lilith used to share the job but he's mostly taken it upon himself to hold memories that others don't want to or can't.

Chloe is our host and a little bundle of emotions who we all love and care for.

Asphodel is the one who cares for Bella and Chloe when Lilith is not awake, she also tries to map out the headspace for us.

Skye is the emotional support companion, they are full of love and just want to give it to everyone.

Andromeda is a failsafe, if nobody else can front then we can rely on it to at least keep us conscious;\
It also mediates issues between us if Lilith is involved, it tries to be a neutral party in matters.

Bella (Also known as Abel) is younger Chloe's brother, and a melanistic Sylveon, also the adoptive child of me and Azzy\
He's a little as far as we know, and not originally part of our system but he lives here\
He's able to come into some of our "rooms" in the headspace\
Typically only the person who's room it is can even see in there unless they invite someone else in but Bella can go into Lilith and Asphodel's rooms freely.

Speaking of the headspace, as far as we've worked out, the inside of the "house" is a fully furnished apartment with rooms for each of us an a communal area, outside it appears like a run down shack.\
The wider area is a very large bamboo forest, with a river running through it and an area of trees leading up to Pixel's shrine.\
There are other areas we have not seen yet, though most of the landscape can be changed if we think about it enough.
