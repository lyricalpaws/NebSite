It took years of thinking, talking with other alterhumans and especially a lot of discussion between headmates, but we came to the conclusion a long time ago now; the signs were pretty obvious, generally disliking and being uncomfortable with having a human body, and little interest in concepts like sex (we're largely asexual).\
\
More specifically to us, it's not that we deny the body is human, more that we reject that it's ours. We weren't meant to all be packed into the body together and were meant to be separate creatures, though we do make do with what we have, it still causes a large amount of dysphoria for us to *have* such a body as we do; this is also largely the reason as to why we are so interested in transhumanism and body modification/experimentation.\
\
The brain is ours but the body is more just like a vessel that carries us all around, and in our mind, we do not consider ourselves to be human, therefore fundamentally we're not human.\
Sometimes we like to refer to the body as a shapeshifter when among other alterhumans or furries in general, it's a way of referring to the body without having to acknowledge it as being human.

Is there a way to help accommodate us with this?
---
Yes, actually. There is.\
\
Firstly, using the name and pronouns of whoever is [fronting](/posts/headmates).\
Alternatively, if you are unsure who is fronting, just calling us **Nebula** is perfectly acceptable, as are **They/Them** pronouns;\
Additionally to this, referring to us by our species as opposed to calling us "people" or "humans", or if referring to our system, calling us "creatures" is most applicable.\
\
Though it is important to remember, **even though we don't directly identify as a human, we're still creatures with free will an agency**, we don't enjoy being bossed around or treated as a lesser thing just because you might treat an animal like such <sup><sub>(keep that for consensual bedroom time.)</sub></sup>\
\
Personally we all have significant dysphoria related to photos of our body, and as such prefer to censor our face wherever possible online, including in video calls and recordings; we request that others respect this and **censor our face where possible**.\
\
When you see us out in public we're most likely masking, that is to say trying out best to "pretend" to be human so we can appear as a normal person to others. This is extremely draining mentally and often causes us to run out of "social battery" quite quickly, we try our best but sometimes that mask slips and if we can't get out of the situation, we often feel like we're a cornered animal and end up acting as such; lashing out at others and hiding away somewhere.\
\
Thankfully being around understanding friends helps us a lot with this, places where we don't have to mask around people. Furry cons are one of the biggest example of this.

Finally, using accommodating language related to our species is greatly appreciated, as well as understanding our species related quirks, for example:
```
They aren't hands and feet, they're paws,

Toes are pawpads,

It isn't our room; it's our den,

We'll often toe-walk when not wearing shoes, or when wearing shoes made for it,

We often make little growls and rumbles, these are usually good noises when 
being given/giving affection, but we do sometimes make them when stressed too,

Despite not physically being there, we have a strong sense of where our tail(s), 
ears and snout should be in space,

We often show affection by cuddling, rubbing against you, or (with consent) biting.
