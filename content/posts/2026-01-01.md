Man the year went pretty quick, its already big 2026.

Last year was pretty good for me all things considered, I managed to get on disability payments so I can pay rent, and I managed to graduate!

My diploma is a **BSc (Hons.) in Biomedical Science**, I passed with a second (60% pass) and overall I'm very happy with the result. I'll probably go on to do my MSc and PhD later on, but I'd like to take a year off study first.

I hope everyone reading this had a good holidays, regardless of what you celebrate and a good new years. 

That's all I have to say for now, but I'll try and post more in this space in the upcoming year~
