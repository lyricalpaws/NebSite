This post is largely going to be in a similar fashion to [this previous post](/posts/nonhuman) and [this post](/posts/2024-07-29), in which I attempt to explain a concept for non (thing) people, but this time it's for singlets instead of humans.

## To start out, we aren't one singular being.

You read that right, there are multiple individual critters, with entire lives lived and fully fledged personalities that live together within one physical body.

We **are**:
- Headmates
- Real critters
- Individuals
- Practically family to each other

We are **not**: 
- "Alter Egos" / Alters
- Personalities
- Made up / Fictional
- Disordered

## Helpful terms and what they mean

### System

This refers to the plural group that resides within, [you can find each of us here](/posts/headmates/) and each of our "roles" [here](/posts/2024-07-29).

We all consider each other found family, and each of us plays a part in keeping the body functioning from day to day.

Each of us is typically able to communicate with others that are conscious within the headspace, if they are "asleep" then we cannot, and have to leave a message.

### Fronting

Put simply, this is who is "controlling" the physical body. Not always the one who is talking to you, but usually that is the case, when two or more critters are fronting, this is called **co-fronting**

### Headspace

The internal landscape we all share, and where we live when we aren't fronting, it's explained a little further [here](/posts/2024-07-29).

### Singlet

Someone who isn't plural, put simply. One being in one brain.

## Basic etiquette

First of all, we don't like being called people, we're critters or creatures. This relates heavily to [most of our system being therians](/posts/nonhuman)

Second of all, please do not assume all of the system have the same interests, likes, dislikes ect. We share some, but we also differ on a lot of matters.

Third of all, please do not try to pry into our trauma or past, if we want to talk about it and we are comfortable doing so, we will. 

Pronouns are important, and while we ask that people respect the pronouns of the critter that is fronting, referring to us collectively with they/them is also fine.

If we're in public or a chat together, please refer to us as Nebula, unless you know who is fronting.

In the same vein, please don't be afraid to ask who's fronting if you aren't sure.
