Confuzzled went well overall, we got to see a lot of friends we were hoping to see, and even made a few new ones.\
We couldn't get early arrival or late departure unfortunately, but we did manage to get a nice room in the Crowne plaza hotel, the staff were extremely nice and the room was comfortable, if a little drab with all the browns and gray colours.\
\
We arrived around 3 pm from the coach and the reg queue was basically empty once us and our roommate were headed down to register and get our badges, Friday overall was very slow in a good way, seeing friends and later on having a movie night. Saturday started out similarly, we went down to the dealers den to do a sweep, I didn't end up getting much, just a book to have friends sign throughout the con; we also got to go to the fursuit menagerie and inflatables meet, which were combined for some reason, though it ended up quite well with some photos.\
\
Afterwards we went to the Alterhuman meetup, we didn't talk much but we enjoyed seeing other critters, Mel (One of the mascots) showed up too for a bit which was nice. Past that we were mostly relaxing for the day, and had another movie night (though I cant remember if it was in our room or not.)\
\
Sunday was the most busy day, we started with meeting up with some friends for a drink and visited the dragons meet, it was extremely warm with not enough fans or lighting due to the vr portal going on at the same time, I got some nice stickers during though. Around 2 pm was the food chain (vore meetup) which was the highlight of the con for us, as most of our friends were there, we got to play a vore themed board game for the most of it. Afterwards we had a lovely dinner with a few other furs we met up with at the meet, the rest of the night was a little bit of a blur, honestly.\
There wasn't much going on Monday, we mostly just wandered around with friends and then eventually got to experience a vore toy after doing another sweep of the dealers den, which was very fun. Tuesday was sad, seeing everyone for the last time at the bar and saying goodbye, eventually getting my coach at 3 pm and heading back home while PCD started to hit.

So anyway! We have a new character now too!
