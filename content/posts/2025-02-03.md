So, to put things straight, I've basically been focused on uni mostly, also dealing with life shit.

I come to you today to help host a couple zines that I feel are very important atm,

These amazing zines were made by https://littlemouse.fun, using info from https://diyhrt.info which is an incredible resource for trans folk, DIY or not.

I'm doing a service for my fellow trans folk in rehosting these zines to spread the word, as much as I can.
