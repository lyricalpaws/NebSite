Terms Of Service (TOS)
---
Payment is required before starting the commission, based on the pricing sheet provided in the card below, payments are taken in GBP through Stripe Payments.

A minimum word count of 300 is required.

Commissions will always take priority over all my other writings.

I am willing to work with OCs but please give me very good and in-depth descriptions of your characters, and a ref if you have one.

Please give me an idea of how many words you would like written. I will try to stick to it, but may go up to 200 words over, however I will confirm this with you. We may discount this from the price in some situations.

I will NOT write about characters existing in copyrighted fiction already (stuff like characters from books and tv shows)

I very much prefer to write about anthro characters to humans, however I will consider humans for writing.

I am willing to write NSFW & SFW.

I am willing to do kinks except the following:\
Age related kinks (Diapers, Age Regression, Cub)\
Scat\
Inflation (Not including weight gain related to vore)

I have the right to refuse any commission for any personal reasons.

Please be specific with what you would like, but an outline of what I am writing for you will be shared so you can determine if you like where the piece is going.

If for any reason you wish to have your money refunded, I will work with you, however depending on how much I've written, the amount refunded will vary:\
10% of work finished = 100% refund\
25% of work finished= 75% refund\
40% of work finished= 50% refund\
55% of work finished = 25% refund\
70+% of work finished = no refund

Please understand that like with any craft, it takes time and effort to make anything thus my refund policy is in stand in the off chance that you are unsatisfied with my writing, but it also secures myself in the fact I will not waste my time.

Once I'm finished with your commission, it will be posted to Furaffinity and my personal website. You may post it anywhere you’d like.

You agree to not: Mint NFTs out of, resell, or use the writing as part of any blockchain or AI-Related projects.
